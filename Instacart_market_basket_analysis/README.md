This directory consists of my work on the InstaCart Market Basket Analysis

Problem Statement:
The main objective is to provide user based recommendsations and predict if a customer is likely to reorder a product or not.

Phase 1: I have performed Exploratory data nalysis and feature enginnering on the various data sources and merged them to create one complete data source to be used in the future phases

Phase 2: Perfomed user based personalized recommendation for a sampled 1000 users and also product based recommendations. Converted implicit ratings to explicit ratings

Phase 3: Performed customer segmentation 

Phase 4: Modelling phase. Predicted if a particular user is likely to reorder a specific product or not.
